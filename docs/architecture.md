# DDD Architecture - Migration Completed ✅

## General Architecture

This project implements a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with **Hexagonal Architecture**.

### Applied Architectural Principles

- ✅ **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters implemented for complete infrastructure decoupling
- ✅ **DDD Tactical Patterns**: Aggregates, Value Objects, Domain Events, Repository Pattern fully functional
- ✅ **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous communication through domain events with Kafka
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Dependencies pointing towards the domain, infrastructure decoupled
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly defined layers with specific responsibilities
- ✅ **SOLID Principles**: Applied throughout the DDD architecture

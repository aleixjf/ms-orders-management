# ADR-001: DDD Architecture

## Context

We need a robust architecture to encapsulate business logic and facilitate future changes. The application was originally built with a more traditional approach, but as the complexity grew, we needed better separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Decision

We will implement **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture with **Hexagonal Architecture** principles.

### Applied Architectural Principles

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters implemented for complete infrastructure decoupling
- **DDD Tactical Patterns**: Aggregates, Value Objects, Domain Events, Repository Pattern fully functional
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous communication through domain events with Kafka
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependencies pointing towards the domain, infrastructure decoupled
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly defined layers with specific responsibilities
- **SOLID Principles**: Applied throughout the DDD architecture

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ Business logic encapsulated in the domain
- ✅ Better testability (pure domain without dependencies)
- ✅ Flexibility to change infrastructure
- ✅ **Decoupling**: Domain independent of infrastructure
- ✅ **Testability**: Pure domain without external dependencies
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Encapsulated and clear business logic
- ✅ **Scalability**: Architecture prepared for growth

### Negative

- ❌ Increased initial complexity and learning curve
- ❌ More boilerplate code required

### Development Benefits

- ✅ **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict types and validation
- ✅ **Event-Driven**: Decoupled asynchronous communication
- ✅ **Clean Code**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- ✅ **Domain Focus**: Business logic as first-class citizen

### Operational Benefits

- ✅ **Gradual Migration**: Both implementations coexist
- ✅ **Rollback**: Possibility to return to legacy if necessary
- ✅ **Comparison**: Equivalent behavior validation
- ✅ **Documentation**: Architecture and decisions documented

## Performance

**DDD**: Potentially better thanks to:

- Asynchronous decoupled events
- Optimized aggregate boundaries
- Clear separation of responsibilities

## Future Work

### Performance & Monitoring

- [ ] APM and observability for domain events
- [ ] Performance testing under load

### Advanced DDD Patterns

- [ ] Event Sourcing for complete audit
- [ ] CQRS for read/write separation
- [ ] Saga Pattern for distributed transactions

### Operational

- [ ] A/B testing in production
